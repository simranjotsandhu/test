## **1. Historical Evolution of AI**
AI has progressed through multiple phases:

- **Rule-Based Systems (1950s-1980s):** Early AI relied on explicitly programmed rules (symbolic AI, expert systems).
- **Machine Learning (1990s-2010s):** Shift towards statistical models that learn patterns from data (SVMs, decision trees).
- **Deep Learning & Neural Networks (2010s - Present):** The rise of neural networks, particularly transformers, led to breakthroughs in NLP.
- **LLMs & Generative AI (2020s-Present):** Advanced models trained on massive datasets using self-supervised learning.

---

## **2. Mathematical Foundations of AI**
AI, and particularly LLMs, is grounded in several mathematical disciplines:

### **a) Linear Algebra**
- **Vectors & Matrices:** Words are represented as high-dimensional vectors (word embeddings).
- **Matrix Multiplication:** Core operation in neural networks, allowing weight transformations.
- **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors:** Used in dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

### **b) Probability & Statistics**
- **Bayesian Inference:** Models uncertainty in predictions.
- **Markov Chains:** Basis for early NLP models like n-grams.
- **Probability Distributions:** LLMs use softmax to convert logits into probability distributions over vocabulary words.

### **c) Calculus**
- **Gradient Descent:** Used to optimize neural network weights.
- **Partial Derivatives:** Essential in backpropagation for computing weight updates.

### **d) Optimization Techniques**
- **Loss Functions:** Cross-entropy loss measures how well the model predicts the correct token.
- **Optimizers:** Adam, RMSprop improve convergence speed.

---

## **3. From Traditional AI to LLMs**
Early NLP models were based on:
- **Bag-of-Words (BoW) & TF-IDF:** Simple statistical representations.
- **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe):** Introduced vector-based word representations.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & LSTMs:** Used for sequence modeling but suffered from vanishing gradient issues.

**Breakthrough: Transformers**
- Introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al. in *"Attention is All You Need."*
- Replaced RNNs with self-attention mechanisms.
- Allowed for **parallelization** and better **long-range dependencies**.

---

## **4. Mathematics Behind LLMs**
### **a) Word Embeddings**
Each word is converted into a **dense vector representation** in an **embedding space**:
\[
\text{word\_vector} = W \cdot x
\]
where:
- \( W \) is the embedding matrix.
- \( x \) is the one-hot encoded vector of a word.

**Cosine Similarity** is used to measure semantic closeness:
\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}
\]
where \( A \) and \( B \) are word vectors.

---

### **b) Self-Attention Mechanism**
The heart of transformers:
1. **Query (Q), Key (K), Value (V) Matrices**:
   \[
   Q = W_q \cdot X, \quad K = W_k \cdot X, \quad V = W_v \cdot X
   \]
   where \( W_q, W_k, W_v \) are learnable weight matrices.

2. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**:
   \[
   \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax} \left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
   \]
   - Softmax normalizes attention scores.
   - Scaling factor \( \sqrt{d_k} \) prevents large values from dominating.

3. **Multi-Head Attention**:
   - Multiple attention heads capture different relationships.
   - Outputs are concatenated and linearly projected.

---

### **c) Transformer Layers**
Each transformer block consists of:
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**
- **Feedforward Network**:
  \[
  \text{FFN}(x) = \max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
  \]
  where \( W_1, W_2 \) are weight matrices.
- **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections**:
  \[
  \text{Output} = \text{LayerNorm}(x + \text{Sublayer}(x))
  \]

---

## **5. Training & Optimization in LLMs**
### **a) Loss Function: Cross-Entropy**
The model minimizes the difference between predicted and actual distributions:
\[
\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
\]
where \( y_i \) is the true label, and \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted probability.

### **b) Backpropagation & Gradient Descent**
- Uses **autograd** to compute gradients of the loss w.r.t. parameters.
- Updates weights using **Adam optimizer**:
  \[
  \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \cdot \frac{m_t}{\sqrt{v_t} + \epsilon}
  \]
  where \( m_t \) and \( v_t \) are moving averages of gradients.
